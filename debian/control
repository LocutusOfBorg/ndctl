Package: ndctl
Section: misc
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Utility for managing the nvdimm subsystem
 The nvdimm subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message
 interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined by the ACPI 6+ NFIT
 (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table).
 .
 This package contains a utility for managing the nvdimm (non-volatile memory
 device) subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Package: libndctl6
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Utility library for managing the libnvdimm subsystem
 The nvdimm subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message
 interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined by the ACPI 6+ NFIT
 (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table).
 .
 This package contains a utility library for managing the libnvdimm
 (non-volatile memory device) sub-system in the Linux kernel.

Package: libndctl-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libndctl6 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for libndctl
 Header files and development library for compiling C programs to link
 with the libndctl library and manage the libnvdimm sub-system in the
 Linux kernel.

Description: Utility for managing the device DAX subsystem
 "DAX" are file system extensions to bypass the page cache and block layer to
 mmap persistent memory, from a PMEM block device, directly into a process
 address space.
 .
 This package contains a utility for managing the device DAX subsystem in the
 Linux kernel.
